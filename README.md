This project has been written in HTML and the page https://dribbble.com/shots/24734214-Wildlife-Blog-Section  has been used as an example. In this project titled “La Madriguera,” the aim was to depict a kennel with various animals and their descriptions, as well as two short paragraphs explaining the objectives of this fictional place.
On the one hand, a header has been created with four options:
Menu: To return the user to the main page while navigating through the site.
Donations: Where it is hoped to include a link to a simple page where bank card details and bank information can be entered.
About Us: Another link that will lead to a page describing the site and the team of people responsible for its care.
Contact: Where a phone number, an email address, and a location can be seen.

Subsequently, ten photos with short descriptions underneath have been added, as mentioned earlier, which are responsive to various types of resolutions. Finally, a footer with a small text has been created to appear on the page whether you scroll up or down.

Although this project has been very small and not done in the best ways, it is expected to gradually take shape into something more worked and professional. So, for now, I must thank Professor Tiburcio for explaining some things to me despite always being short of time, and Jesus, my desk mate, because thanks to him this project has advanced a bit more. I also want to thank Gabi and Richard, who have helped me as much as they could even when I didn't know how to ask them my questions. 

This project has been created by Amanda Fu Die Cruz Sosa, from 1ºDAMTA.
